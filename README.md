GDSC AIML INDUCTIONS CODE
done (in order of completion)
question 1 - beginner : Will I get placed?
Using this Placement Dataset predict whether a student will be placed or not using any ML algorithm of your choice.
Deliverable(s):
Exploratory Data Analysis to understand trends, patterns, and factors influencing student placements.
Building and evaluating a predictive model to determine placement outcomes. 
Ensuring the prediction model achieves more than 60% accuracy.

question 2 - intermediate:Predict how painfully slow the hostel Wi-Fi will be tonight?
Using the Internet Usage Data, predict just how painfully slow the hostel Wi-Fi will be at any given time. Base your predictions on session start time, active usage durations, and total data transferred. Basically, figure out when the combination of binge‑streaming, Zoom marathons, and last-minute assignment uploads will affect the speed of your connection.
Deliverable(s):
Explore the dataset to uncover peak usage hours, data-hungry users, and the classic “Idle-Timeout” excuses.
Engineer features like hour-of-day, session intensity, and average transfer rates to capture Wi-Fi chaos.
Build and evaluate a regression model to predict Wi-Fi speed/load.
Visualize predictions vs reality and highlight the worst-case “Peak hours” for students.
Optional bonus: Suggest the best time for binge-watching or downloading assignments.

question 3 - beginner : How much do I study and how much do I sleep?
Using the Sleep and Study Dataset, predict how well a student will score    based on how much they study and how little they sleep. Basically, you need to assert whether “all-nighters” are a myth or a miracle.
     Deliverables(s):
Building and evaluating a regression model to predict exam scores using simple features such as Sleep Hours, Study Hours, and Stress Level.
Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover legendary trends like whether more sleep actually beats all-nighters, and if extra study hours can compensate for chronic sleep deprivation.
Ensuring the model performs reasonably well (good R² or MAE).
